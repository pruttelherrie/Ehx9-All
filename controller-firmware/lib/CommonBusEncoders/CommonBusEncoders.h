  CommonBusEncoders.h
  Created by : Jacques Bellavance, March 26, 2017
  Released into the public domain.

  This library is designed to use multiple encoders with the least amount of digital pins.
  The first encoder requires 4 pins. the remaining ones require only one extra pin per encoder.
  For use with quadratic encoders with 2 or 4 steps per detent, 
  and need to be actuated by hand. This Library does not use interrupts.
  See the Tutoriel for more information
